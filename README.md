## Main Features
- Dynamic Homepage

- Data Storage and Display

## Abandoned Features
__Features I would have liked to implement or which were abandoned due to technical constraints__:
- Modifying the database from the website (abandoned)
- Table sorting system
- Modifying the database to add elements such as images or information (abandoned)
- Password hashing for a more secure system (lack of time)
- Data transmission via `jsonify`
- Simply type the brand name and see the latest processor releases

## About the code
- I've tried to comment most of the important parts of the code (Python, JS, CSS, and some pages like `base`, etc.). There may still be some errors; I did my best.

- Some parts don't fully adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, particularly the JS for the `toggleIcon` functions.

## Installation and Execution
1. Run: main.py
2. Access the application via `http://127.0.0.1:5559` or `http://192.168.1.48:5559`
> Using the second URL, you can connect to the site from another local computer
